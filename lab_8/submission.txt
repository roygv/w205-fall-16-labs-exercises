Lab 8 submission
================
1. 5377 of the values are blank. Total states are 61 (+blank) which is wrong. To solve this I uploaded a list of states to a new tab (named "states") and I added a calculated column with the following GREL grel:cell.cross("states", "Abbrev").cells["Abbrev"].value[0]. In the new column I can see the total number of values that failed to lookup: 6648.
2. 4362 rows are missing zip code.
3. The zipcodes were already loaded as Text. To answer the question I used: 
   grel:if(value.length() > 4, value, '99999'). 
   After applying the transformation there are:
	 4,362: Blanks
        34,961: 99999 (invalid, of which 17 were in the original data the rest had less than 5 digits)
       345,192: Good values (5 digits less than 99999)
4. It is offering to merge Tajikistan with Pakistan and Indonesia with Micronesia, in addition to a few good matches for California and Alaska.
5. California <-> Calfiornia <-> Cailfornia
   Alaska <-> alaska
   Canada <-> Candaa
6. When I try to cluster by "place" because of the field length the algorithm needs to compare a lot more combinations.
   The complexity of the comparison is roughly O(len(place)^2). The average length is roughly triple that of "location"
   so the computation time will be about nine times longer.
